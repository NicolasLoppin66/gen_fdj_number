# FdjNumber

This project contains Python scripts for generating and managing numbers, likely related to FDJ (Fran√ßaise des Jeux) lottery or similar number-based games.

## Files

- `main.py`: The main entry point of the application. This file typically contains the core logic for running the program.
- `index.py`: May contain additional functions, classes, or serve as a module for supporting code used by `main.py`.

## Usage

1. **Run the main script**:

   ```powershell
   python main.py
   ```

   This will execute the main logic of the project.

2. **Modify or extend functionality**:
   - Edit `index.py` to add or update helper functions or classes.
   - Edit `main.py` to change the main workflow or integrate new features.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies are required unless specified in the code.

## Project Purpose

This project is designed to help generate, process, or analyze numbers for FDJ-related games. You can customize the logic in `main.py` and `index.py` to fit your specific needs.
